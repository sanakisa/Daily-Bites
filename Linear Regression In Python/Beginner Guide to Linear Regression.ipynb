The y and x variables remain the same, since they are the data features and cannot be changed. The values that we can control are the intercept(b) and slope(m). There can be multiple straight lines depending upon the values of intercept and slope. Basically what the linear regression algorithm does is it fits multiple lines on the data points and returns the line that results in the least error.\n",
